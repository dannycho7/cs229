{\bf Honor code:} 
If you are unfamiliar with the honor code policy, please read the policy on the course website.
Again, if you submit in pairs, please make sure to attach both names to the Gradescope submission.
Further, because we may reuse problem set questions from previous years, we expect students not to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers. It is an honor code violation to intentionally refer to a previous year's solutions.
